# View Distance Tuner


A simple paper plugin to change server view/simulation distance while live.

Originally created for the mc.kirk55.com minecraft server.




Inspired by View Distance Tweaks, but way simpiler without the automatic detection. Purely admin controlled, While using the same command format.


## Note


This plugin isn't meant for everyone and is purely made to meet specific requirements needed by a minecraft server I thoroughly enjoy. Additions are likely not to be added unless requested by server's admins. Please do not ask.
